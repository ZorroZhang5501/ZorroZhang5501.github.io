Dynamic Pricing for Multi-Product Consumer Electronics Trade-in Program</a> <br> with <a href="https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/zhou-sean-xiang/">Sean Zhou</a> and <a href="https://murraylei.github.io/">Yanzhe (Murray) Lei</a> <br> <b>Under Major Revision, <i>Operations Research</i></b> (updated Nov. 23, 2022) <br><button class="accordion">
  Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>We consider a dynamic pricing problem for consumer electronics trade-in program, where a firm buys and sells multiple types of pre-owned (used) products over a finite selling horizon. The trade-in program offers two options: trade-in for cash and trade-in for upgrade, where in the former customers sell their products to the firm and receive cash payment while in the latter they exchange their products for new products at discounted prices. The firm sets trade-in prices (both cash rewards and new products' discounts) to acquire used products and selling prices to resell them after simple refurbishments (refurbished products) to maximize its total expected profit over the selling horizon. Customer arrivals follow independent Poisson processes. We model customer preferences and choices on both trade-in and selling sides using the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. In view of the challenge of solving the optimal prices using dynamic programming due to high dimensional state space, we develop simple and provably effective heuristic policies based on the solution to a deterministic upper bound problem. In the first policy called the Static Control (SC) policy, we set buffers at the beginning of the selling horizon to accumulate a certain amount of refurbished products inventories before starting to sell them. We show that the profit loss of this policy is in the order of O(T^{1/2}), where T is the number of selling periods. Meanwhile, we also derive a profit loss lower bound in the order of \Omega(T^{1/2}) of any static stationary policy. In the second policy called the Batched-Adjustment Control (BAC) policy, we divide the selling horizon into different consecutive and disjoint batches for different products and update the prices based on the realized uncertainties in the previous batch. The profit loss of the BAC policy is in the order of O(T^{1/3}), which is significantly smaller than that of the SC policy. Furthermore, we extend both heuristic policies to the case where the firm needs to decide the initial stocking levels of new products (for upgrade purposes). Finally, we numerically test the performance of both heuristic policies, and demonstrate that the BAC policy has superior performance over the SC policy. Some model parameters in the numerical study are estimated using real data from a major consumer electronics trade-in platform in China.</p></div>

Innovative Business Models in Ocean-Bound Plastic Recycling</a> <br> with <a href="https://www.bschool.cuhk.edu.hk/staff/zhou-sean-xiang/">Sean Zhou</a>, <a href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/facultyandresearch/faculty/facultybios/baron">Opher Baron</a> and <a href="https://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/FacultyAndResearch/Faculty/FacultyBios/Romero">Gonzalo Romero</a> <br> <b>Under Major Revision, <i>Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management</i></b> (updated Apr. 7, 2023) <br><button class="accordion"> 
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Problem definition: About 30 million tons of plastic waste -or 10% of the world's annual plastic production- reach the oceans each year, most from developing coastal countries. We study novel business models of firms aiming to reduce ocean plastic pollution with a triple bottom line (TBL) objective that is a weighted sum of profit, environmental and social impacts. These firms sell (a) plastic offsets and (b) segregated plastic. Methodology/results: We introduce and analyze models where a firm partners with a plastic recycling supply chain comprising collectors and a processor to sell (a) or (b) or both. We show that selling (a) or (b) generates positive environmental and social impacts, and gives the firm a positive profit (as long as the weight associated with profit is not too small). Selling (b) gives a larger share of the local supply chain surplus to the collectors than (a). A profit-maximizing firm generates positive social and environmental impacts as long as the local price of recycled plastic is not too high. Furthermore, when the firm sells both (a) and (b), it attains a higher TBL value than (a) or (b) but could perform worse than (b) in the collectors' share of local supply chain surplus and worse than (a) in terms of its social or environmental impacts. We also perform a numerical study calibrated with real data. Managerial Implications: Selling both (a) and (b) may not always give the firm a higher TBL value than the sum of selling (a) or (b) alone; and firms that employ a TBL objective can generate much larger environmental and social impacts with a slight reduction in profits than profit-maximizing firms. For a profit-maximizing firm, it is easier to generate social and environmental impacts if the local price of recycled plastic is low or the number of collectors is not large. Our model and results provide theoretical support and insights into new initiatives for tackling ocean plastic pollution.</p></div>

      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Does temperature affect real economic activity? Using the annual Current Population Survey between 1963 and 2015, we show that there is no association between temperature and earnings, hours, or output after controlling for time-invariant spatial heterogeneity and time-varying demographic factors. These results are robust to five separate sources of micro-data, different sampling horizons, functional forms, spatial measures of temperature, and subsets of the data. This paper studies the relationship between temperature and productivity across space and time. Motivated by these null results, we develop a spatial equilibrium model where temperature can affect not only firm productivity, but also individual locational choice. After calibrating the model, we use it to disentangle the role of reallocation versus actual productivity losses in the U.S. economy between 1980 and 2015. Nearly all of the variation is driven by reallocation. We subsequently use the model to evaluate a counterfactual climate scenario and recover a new spatial equilibrium for the U.S. economy by 2050. </p></div><br>

    <p style="margin:0"> <b>The Role of Supply and Demand Factors in Explaining the Migration of College Majors</b> <br><button class="accordion">
      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>  This paper documents a new stylized fact about the United States labor market: internal migration rates are dramatically different across college majors. For some college majors, migration rates are even lower than those without a college degree. I relate major migration rates with majors' spatial concentration and find that a major's spatial concentration explains about one fourth of the cross-major variation in migration rates. With this descriptive evidence as a guide, I estimate a structural model of locational choice where college graduates have heterogeneous preferences---at the detailed major level---for living close to home, and for working in a location with a high concentration of their fellow majors. Using estimates of the structural model, I decompose the cross-major migration rates into supply and demand factors and find that supply factors (i.e. moving costs) explain the vast majority of differences in migration rates across majors. My findings underscore the difficulty in attracting college majors to a particular location using demand-side investments. My results also highlight the importance of place in determining the labor market outcomes of college majors.</p></div><br>
